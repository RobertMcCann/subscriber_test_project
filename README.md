I completed this by going through the amazing tutorial by Web Dev Simplified.

[Build A REST API With Node.js, Express, & MongoDB - Quick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgTGADljAeg) 

I could not get .env to work with this tutorial though, hopefully I can look back on this in the future and figure out why :)

It uses:

Mongoose, Express and Nodemon (dotenv too, but as mentioned above not currently working)
